            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:176292:6"/> the world; the clearest and shortest way of explication, is by Paraphrase: many learned Interpreters, both of our Church, and the Roman, have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this taske by parcels, the use and benefit whereof, is, and should no lesse, be universall: My meannesse hath therefore boldly endeavoured this great worke; which, as I durst not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, without the aide of the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters, both ancient and moderne; so I do in all humility subject it to the grave and holy judgement of this renowned Church: it is so farre from my thoughts, peremptorily to prescribe senses unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as that I am ready upon better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to amend my owne errours: Onely my desire, and ambition is, to give some light to weaker apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wherein I hope to do a service, not utterly unbeseeming your Majesties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Patronage; and unspeakably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to many thousands of soules; who shall blesse God for the least glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pses of illumination in these divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot be so weake, as not to presuppose, that so great, and bold a worke must needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe variety of constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: There will not want some, I doubt not, who will be of opinion, that this labour might have beene better spared; as thinking the Scriptures to lie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too open to vulgar hands; with whom it is not now seasonable to argue that beaten questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the expedience of the free allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods Booke to Laick readers; wherein the Church of England (our deare and blessed mother) hath sufficiently declared her judgement (besides words) by her ingenuous practice; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore taking this liberty for granted, I shall easily from hence evince the usefulnesse of some such plaine and orthodox explication; For, since the Scriptures are through the liberall bessing of God, promiscuously allowed to all hands, I aske whether it bee not much better they should bee put into the way of being rightly understood by the simplest, then to lie under the danger of an ignorant mis-construction; Neither doe I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indevour to make them more common, but better conceived; that, where the letter is in use, the sense may not be mis-taken; The inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that are pretended to have followed upon the open, and free permission of Scriptures in
<pb facs="tcp:176292:8"/> vulgar languages, have sensibly arisen from the mis-understanding of them; remove that perill, &amp; the frequence and universality of thē can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a blessing; This service I have here inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to perform; having cōmonly in the passages of this worke, trod in the steps (as I have judged) of the best interpretations: &amp; seldome when, gone alone: Neither doe I offer to obtrude these my explications upon any reader, as Magisteriall, and peremptory; Who am I that I should take upō me to governe, and command other mens thoughts? but modestly and humbly propound them to Gods Church, as probable helpes to weaker judgements: leaving my reader free, in the meane time, if my sense satisfie not, to his owne further disquisition: Onely, since all men have not choice of commenters, nor leasure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, nor skill to judge of the fairest sense, I have undertaken this paines for the ease and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my plaine reader, to cull out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto him, the most safe, and likely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. In the historicall part, he shall need little help, in the Poeticall, or Sapientiall, more; in the propheticall most of all; in many passages whereof, every line is a riddle; I should bee vaine to brag of my fidelity herein; as who have not knowingly omitted any clause, wherein there seemed to be any shew of difficulty; nor clogged the volume with glosses that I conceived unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>Some perhaps will imagine it might have been much better, to have taken the whole text before me, then to have thus selected some noted periods of harder construction; Who may be pleased to consider how much vastnesse might so have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewed to this labour, and how little use; To pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase easie texts, had beene to set up a candle
<pb facs="tcp:176292:8"/> before the Sunne; and to publish the whole Text, with a partiall explication (if leave might possibly have beene obtained for so bold a project) had beene to raise the bulke, and to lose the vigour and benefit of the worke: Since there be some historicall bookes of Scripture, wherein there is very little use of any Paraphrase; and some (as those of the Chronicles) wherein there is none at all; Herein therefore I have done that, which I judged to availe most to the use and profit of my Christian Reader; whō I must suppose furnished with a Bible at home; and willing to helpe his understanding in places of more obscurity.</p>
                  <p>To fore-mention the particularities of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which may arise to Gods Church in the use of so plaine an enarration of the meaning of his holy Spirit, were both too much to distrust the judgement of others; and to seeme to set forth the glory of my owne indevours; the infirmities whereof, if they may receive pardon from God, and my Superiours; and amendment from more able hands, to whose aide and correction I doe humbly submit my selfe, and them, it shall bee the utmost of my ayme, and ambition.</p>
                  <p>That good God, who hath graciously inabled mee, notwithstanding the throng of other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to goe through with this well-meant worke, blesse it to the behoofe of his Church, and the glory of his owne Name. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>Moreover, the law was in his due time given by God,<note place="margin">20 Moreover, the Law entred, that the offence might abound: but where sinne abounded, grace did much more abound.</note> unto man, that sinne might be knowne to be, as it is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurably sinfull; and might be acknowledged hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; and withall, not without the gracious, and wise counsell of God, who meant, from the greater hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes to winne so much more glory, and praise to his mercy; in that, where sinne abounded, his grace did much more abound in the remission thereof, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therefrom.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:176292:452"/> or to alter it: How much more shall the covenant, that God himselfe made with Abraham, be firme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, and to his seedes, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ.</note>Now to Abraham, and to his seed were the promises made; I will be the God of thee, and thy seed; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; And though the word Seed, do in the signification thereof imply a collection, or multitude, yet in this sense it is, in the use, and intention of God, restrained to one, even Christ; who is, by a specialty, that seed of Abraham, by, and through whom the blessing is derived to all nations.</p>
                     <p>And this I inferre hereupon; this being an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call covenant, which was made before hand, with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, of blessing and salvation, to be had by, and in his seede, Christ; it cannot be that the law which was given foure hundred and thirty yeares after, should disanull it; and make this so ancient, and firme a promise of none effect.<note place="margin">17 And this I say, that the covenant that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before of God in Christ, the Law which was foure hundred and thirty yeares after, cannot disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null, that it should make the promise of none effect.</note>

                     <p>For the law and the promise cannot both stand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if righteousnesse and salvation be by the workes of the Law, then it is not to be had, by vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; But God gave it to Abraham, by promise;<note place="margin">18 For if the inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not upon workes.</p>

As (for one) the law was given to bridle and restraine the transgressions of men; to shew them their sinnes and imperfections, that in a sense of their vilenesse, they might seeke unto Christ, who is that seed in whom the promise of the blessing was both made and accomplished; and this law was ordained and given of God, by the ministery of Angels, in the hand of a third person, that should go betweene God, and his people, as a messenger or mediator; even Moses, who was to take the Law from the hand of Angels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to the people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">20 Now a Mediator is not a Mediator of one, but God is one.</note>Now a Mediator implies a difference; there cannot be a Mediator, where there is but one side; God being one therefore, the people must be the other party; and thereupon it will follow, that the law is so farre from an intendment of giving life, as that in the delivery of it, it argues a difference, betwixt God and his people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">21 Is the Law then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had beene a law given, which could have given life, verily righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse should have been by the law.</note>What then? is God in these proceedings, contrary to himselfe, in giving a law and promises contrary to each other? as if hee would have saved men by the Law first;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:176292:452"/> and then altering his purpose resolved to save them by his promise? God forbid; No, God is constant to his owne determinations herein. For if men could have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to life by the keeping of the Law; there had been no use of the righteousnesse of faith.</p>
                     <p>But now the Scripture hath made knowne to us our universall sinfulnesse, wherewith every soule is tainted, and bound over to death; so as no man can looke for any advantage from the law; so as now there is just roome made for the necessary supply of the promises of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith in Christ, to be obtained of all them, that beleeve in him.<note place="margin">22 But the Scripture hath concluded all under sinne, that the promise by faith of Iesus Christ might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, before this happy supply of faith came, we were all obnoxious unto the law, and to the condemnation threatned to the breakers of it; and were (as it were) shut up close prisoners under the law, and reserved for this comfortable release of faith, in that Saviour which should afterward be revealed.<note place="margin">23 But before faith came, wee were kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, shut up unto the faith, which should afterwards be revealed.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore the law was not intended to perfect us, as of it selfe, but onely to bee our Schoole-master to train us up unto the higher forme of Christ; that by it we being convinced of our owne imperfections, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, might seeke for our justification by faith in Christ.<note place="margin">24 Wherefore the law was our Schoole-master to bring us unto Christ, that wee might be justified by faith.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But after that faith is once wrought in the heart, wee are no longer under the tyrannie, rigour, malediction of the Law; which is as the ferule of that hard Schoole-master.<note place="margin">25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Schoole-master.</note>
                     </p>

                     <p>Upon which situation of the earth it came to passe,<note place="margin">6 Whereby the world that then was, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with water, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</note> by the just and holy decree of God, that the world of men that then was, being overflowed with water, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
                     <p>But these lower regions of the heavens,<note place="margin">7 But the heavens, and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perdition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</note> and the earth which wee doe now presently see, after that change wrought by the deluge, are, by the same all-wise and just decree of God, continued in the state wherein they still are, and reserved for a contrary meanes of dissolution; which shall be by fire, in that great day of the generall judgement, and of the finall destruction of the wicked, and ungodly.<note place="margin">8 But (beloved) be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand yeares, and a thousand yeares as one day.</note>

                     <p>The Lord, who hath promised to come,<note place="margin">9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise (as some men count slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) but is long suffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> is not slacke in the performance of that promise of his (according as men take slacknesse) so as to put off, and disappoint the day which he had set, but in his mercifull long suffering to us ward (as he had eternally decreed) hee waites for our repentance; as taking no pleasure in the destruction of any of his creatures, but gratiously inviting all men to repent and be saved.</p>
                     <p>Neverthelesse wee, according to his promise,<note place="margin">13 Neverthelesse we, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise, looke for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse.</note> looke for, (after that this visible, and lower fabricke of the world shall be purged, with this last and universall fire, from those drossie and impure qualities which are in it)
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:176292:501"/> a new heaven, and a new earth, pure and glorious; so as the whole purified world (that then shall remaine) shall be the palace, and habitation of Gods elect.</p>
                     <p>But ye, beloved, seeing ye know these things, and are admonished,<note place="margin">17 Ye therfore beloved, seeing yee know these things before, beware lest ye also being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your owne stedfastnesse.</note> before-hand, of the danger of these pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent doctrines, beware lest ye bee led away with these atheous suggestions of wicked men, and doe thereupon fall from that stedfast profession which yee have hitherto made of the truth.</p>
